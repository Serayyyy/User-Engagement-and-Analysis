# Project Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze user engagement metrics to optimize subscription strategies for our application. By examining key metrics such as user counts, payment dates, and trial processes, we aim to uncover insights that will lead to improved user retention and revenue growth.

In this project, we will conduct a detailed analysis of various metrics and graphs to understand user behavior and enhance our strategies. Below are the main topics we will examine, along with their importance and relevant visuals:

## 1. Event and User Count with User Count Percentile
We will analyze user events and total user counts along with user count percentiles. This data allows us to evaluate the engagement level of users within the application.

Increasing user engagement is critical for ensuring user loyalty and achieving revenue growth.

## 2. Average Payment Date and Registration Date
Analyzing the average payment dates and registration dates provides important insights into users' subscription timelines and payment habits.

This metric helps us understand at which stage users make payments and allows us to optimize the timing of our marketing campaigns.

## 3. First Payment, Registration, and Trial Start
Examining the dates of the first payment, registration, and trial start allows us to better understand users' subscription processes.

This data enables us to identify necessary improvements to increase conversion rates and helps us analyze the experiences users have during the trial period.

## 4. Registered User Count and Trial Process
Analyzing the registered user count by month and the trial process helps us evaluate the effectiveness of our user acquisition strategies.

Monthly changes indicate which periods saw an increase in user registrations and highlight fluctuations during the transition to the trial process.
